# Data-mining-exercises
This repository contains a collection of **9 Jupyter notebooks** used to prepare for the **Data Mining** course at the University of Pisa. The notebooks cover various stages of data analysis, including:
- **Data preprocessing:** cleaning, normalization, feature selection and transformation
- **Exploratory data analysis (EDA):** visualizing and understanding dataset characteristics
- **Classification and regression tasks**

Each notebook focuses on a specific dataset, illustrating the **steps from raw data to model evaluation**. This repository is intended as a personal study resource and demonstration of data mining techniques learned during the course.
