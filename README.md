# Data-mining-exercises
This repository contains a collection of **9 Jupyter notebooks** used to prepare for the **Data Mining** course at the University of Pisa. The notebooks cover various stages of data analysis, including:
- **Data preprocessing:** cleaning, normalization, feature selection and transformation
- **Exploratory data analysis (EDA):** visualizing and understanding dataset characteristics
- **Classification and regression tasks**

Each notebook focuses on a specific dataset, illustrating the **steps from raw data to model evaluation**. This repository is intended as a personal study resource and demonstration of data mining techniques learned during the course.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

To get started with these notebooks, follow these steps:
## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

To get started with these notebooks, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/chiaraipp/Data-mining-exercises.git
    cd Data-Mining-Exercises
    ```

2.  **Use base Anaconda environment:**
    It's highly recommended to use the same environment as the notebooks
    ```bash
    conda activate base
    ```
    Alternatively you can create a new virtual environment and install the same dependencies,        but using the base environment will match the original setup. 

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    With your environment activated, install all required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Launch Jupyter Lab/Notebook:**
    Finally, you can launch Jupyter and open the notebooks in your browser:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

## üöÄ Usage

Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and open any `.ipynb` file to explore the examples. Each notebook is self-contained and demonstrates a complete workflow from data loading to model evaluation.
