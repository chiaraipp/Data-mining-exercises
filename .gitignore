# Data files (IMPORTANT: Adjust based on your project's data strategy)
# Generally, you want to VERSION CONTROL smaller, cleaned datasets,
# but IGNORE very large raw datasets or generated outputs.

# Example: Ignore all CSV files in a 'data' folder
# data/*.csv

# Example: Ignore specific large raw data files
# data/raw_data_very_large.csv
# data/huge_image_dataset/

# Example: Ignore output directories
# results/
# outputs/
# models/           # If you save trained models locally and they are large
# generated_plots/

# Database files
